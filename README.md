DODO is an Android Utility application made by me to explore the concepts of android architecture like MVVM, Room database, Services, Fragment lifecycles and more.

The app consists of 
- Todo List management, create and delete tasks as per user needs.
- Reminder management, same as alarms. explores Notification channels and background services.
- Notes management, This uses Room database to store and retrieve huge amount of data.
- Clipboard, this is a work in progress idea. the concept for this is to act like a dropbox that store Images and textviews immediately without much hassle, perhaps using drag and drop feature.
